## Problem: Can-you-hack-FTP

FTP doesn't encrypt its traffic. You can really see usernames, passwords and data in clear text. Maybe you might be able to see the flag as well! 

## Hint:
Open the pcap file in a suitable application. The flag is waiting to be seen.

## Explanation:
As all transmitted data is not encrypted, you can clearly see everything by viewing the pcap file which has captured all packets.
