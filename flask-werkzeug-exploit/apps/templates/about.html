        <h3>Project Information</h3>
        <p>
            Welcome to my blog! I have developed this blog using Flask and Werkzeug. Flask is a micro web framework written in Python and Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. This is my first ever project and I am excited to show it to you! This application is currently being developed and is debugged with Werkzeug's debug mode.
